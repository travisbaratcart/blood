                    With BloodShare, we connect donors to hospitals to set up appointments when that donors blood type is in particular need. We've optimized the process as much as possible, ensuring that donors will only receive notifications when they want them and that donors can easily make appointments that are convenient for both the donor and the facility drawing the blood.

                    As a donor, you will set your blood type and a threshold. When the blood level of your favorite hospital or blood center falls under that threshold, we send you a single email which contains instructions on how to set up an appointment. The appointment process takes less than 5 clicks. You'll receive this email only once and we won't bother you again for a month.

                <p class="text-faded" style="font-size: 1.2em">                    As a hospital, we give you controls to report your blood levels for users to see, as well as tools to set up events like blood drives. By setting your hours of operation and availability, users can quickly and easily make appointments after receiving notification of your needs.
